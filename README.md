# Social Network (API)

## Description
So for this project, we have an API for a social web application, where people can share thier thoughts, and react to other users.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Usage 
To use my API, you will have to install all the packages, witch is already done for you. Then you will have to type NPM start on the terminal and wah la. Make sure to have fun with it.
